description: <p>Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and natural selection has been
  debated and disparaged over time, but there is no dispute that he is responsible
  for some of the most remarkable and groundbreaking scientific findings in history.
  His five-year trip as a naturalist on the H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>took him on a journey
  to such exotic locales as Chile, Argentina, and the Galapagos Islands. Darwin wrote
  the details of this expedition, including his thoughts about the people on the ship
  and of course, his observations of the flora and fauna, in his journal, published
  as <i>Voyage of the Beagle.</i> It is here that his original interpretations of
  the Galapagos ecosystem and the impact of nature and selection are first revealed.<br><br>This
  edition of the classic travel memoir is enhanced with an introduction by bestselling
  nature writer David Quammen, and is part of National Geographic's major cross-platform
  event in spring 2009 to celebrate the anniversary.
